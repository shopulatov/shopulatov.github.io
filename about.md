# About

I am **Machine Learning Engineer** at **Tahrirchi.uz** where we are trying to create Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) models. My major role in there includes collecting and preprocessing data for Transformer based Large Language Models as well as training them in Uzbek language. Prior to that, I tutored  students in Math and Problem Solving for elite school selection tests. 

In this blog, you will often see me writing (and/or translating) about different topics (mostly in the field of Machine Learning) explaining them in a simple language in theory along with their implementation (that is the goal, not the result). Blogs are in Uzbek along with English language as well.

All opinions are my own.
