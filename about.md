# About

My name is Abror Shopulatov, currently **freshman student** at **University of South Florida**. My major is *Computational and Applied Math* as my areas of interest are included to, but not restricted to, applied part of math such as AI and Software Engineering. Prior to that, I competed at several regional and republician math competitions at high school. 

In that blog, I am going to highlight some of thing that I found interesting. All of the work is personal, so you might disagree some or all of it. In that case feel free to email me.
