# About

I am **freshman student** at **University of South Florida**. My major is *Computational and Applied Math* as my areas of interest are included to, but not restricted to, applied part of math such as AI and Statistical Learning. Prior to that, I competed at several regional and republician math competitions at high school. 

You will often see me writing (and/or translating) about different topics (mostly in the field of Machine Learning) explaining them in a simple language in theory along with their implementation. Also, writings are in English along with Uzbek language as well.

All of the work is personal, so you might disagree some or all of it. In that case feel free to email me.

Other than this blog, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abrorshopulatov/), [GitHub](https://www.github.com/shopulatov), [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abrorshopulatov) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/murodbek)
