I am a **Machine Learning Engineer** at **Tahrirchi.uz** where we are trying to create NLP and Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) applications for Uzbek language. My major role in there includes collecting and preprocessing data for Transformer based Large Language Models as well as training/fine-tuning them. Prior to that, I tutored students in Math and Problem Solving for elite school selection tests. 

Opinions are my own.

I initially started writing blogs here, but find Substack more suitable. If you are interested, feel free to go https://murodbek.substack.com/ and enjoy.
